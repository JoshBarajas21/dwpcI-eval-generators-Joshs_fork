# STEPS

1. I need to add an object on generator functions "iterateSuperHeroes" and "iterateSuperPowers", on the first we call by "superheroe".
2. After on the second function call "heroeVisited", then I save this on an object using yeild.
3. After declared "generatorObject", I need to modifique the iterator block (for...of cycle)
4. On iterator I need to use two variables "counter" and "found", the two befores will use in the cycle.
5. to last in the cycle, I use an object to pass the value of "generatrorObject", this form was to recive two values [property]: [value].
6. Then on the if cycle, if "found" equals false, I print on screen "No se ha encontrado".
